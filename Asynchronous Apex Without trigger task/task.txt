
Without trigger task.

Task goal of this is creating of 5 classes to practice using async features of the APEX language.

Based on created data model add following logic:

    Create class with future method. Inside the method do the following:

        Select 150 Accounts from database.
        For accounts in which BillingAddress is not empty select all related Contacts 
        Set to all Contacts Is Synced = false; Processed By Future = true;
        Run created class using DevConsole.

    Create Queueble Job to perform similar logic:

        For accounts in which BillingAddress is not empty select all related Contacts
        Set to all Contacts Is Synced = false; Processed By Queue = true;
        Run created class using DevConsole.

    Create Batch Job which select all Ð¡ontacts with Is Synced = false

        Batch should copy from Account.BillingAddress to Contact.MailingAddress
        Set Contact.IsSynced__c = true;
        Update Account field Updated By Contact = true;
        Use Query Locator
        Create similar Batch and use Iterable

    Create Scheduled Job which runs every 30 minutes and call 2 created batches
